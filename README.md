# Checkout kata

A take home task by an English fintech company.

Available at https://checkout-kata.web.app


## Improvements Needed

- Sync product promotion when changing a promo to Meal Deal (syncing all of the involved products).
- The app would need translations to every market that we would make it available for.
- Ideally we would have 100% test coverage


## How to run

In the project root, run:

``` flutter pub get ```

### Android
To run for Android, you can just debug or, if you have attached devices, run:

``` flutter run ```

You can attach devices with: ``` flutter attach -d <DEVICE_ID> ```

Check https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/flutter-cli for more info.

### iOS

I did not test in iOS.

The project should run in iOS by following the same instructions as in the <b>Android</b> section.

### Web

Run the debugger with the selected device being a browser or run: ``` flutter run -d chrome ```, to run on Google Chrome.
This should work for any browser that you have.
